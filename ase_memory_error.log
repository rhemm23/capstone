@ERROR: ASE has detected a memory READ to an UNPINNED memory region.
        Simulation cannot continue, please check the code.
          Failure @ byte-level phys_addr = 0xc0db40e0c0

        See ERROR log file ase_memory_error.log and timestamped
        transactions in ccip_transactions.tsv.
@ERROR: Check that previously requested memories have not been deallocated
        before an AFU transaction could access them.
        NOTE: If your application polls for an AFU completion message,
              and you deallocate after that, consider using a
              write fence before AFU status message. The simulator may
              be committing AFU transactions out of order.
